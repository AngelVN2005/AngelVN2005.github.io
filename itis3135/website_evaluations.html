                <h3>CRAP Principles</h3>
                <p>The CRAP principles: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. Are important in web design because they help create pages that are clear, organized, and visually effective. Contrast makes important elements stand out so users can quickly find key information. Repetition creates consistency in colors, fonts, and styles, which makes a site feel unified and professional. Alignment keeps content structured and visually connected, improving readability and flow. Proximity groups related items together so users can easily understand how information is related. When used together, these principles improve usability and user experience, helping visitors navigate and understand a website more efficiently.</p>
            
                <p>Here we have a couple of examples on how following the CRAP principles can improbe the overall look of a site.</p>

            <!--Bad Page Example-->
            <section class="infoBlock">
                <!--Page Name-->
                <h3><a href="https://arngren.net">ARNGREN.net</a></h3>

                <figure>
                    <!--Image-->

                <!--List Explaining Stuff-->
                <h4>How does this website adhere to the C.R.A.P principles ?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Contrast: </b>The site shows poor contrast choices in many item descriptions and links, which makes the reading experience visually exhausting. While colors like red, blue, and green are not bad individually, using them all together without considering how they interact creates visual conflict and reduces readability.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Repetition: </b>The site lacks effective repetition in its visual design. Fonts, colors, link styles, and box borders vary widely across the page, which creates inconsistency and visual noise. Instead of reinforcing a unified style, each section appears to follow different formatting rules, making the overall design feel chaotic rather than cohesive.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Alignment: </b>Alignment is poorly handled throughout the page, as images, text blocks, and links appear scattered without a clear grid or structure. Many elements are unevenly spaced and misaligned with each other, which makes the layout feel cluttered and difficult to scan. The lack of consistent alignment reduces readability and makes navigation more confusing.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Proximity: </b>The site demonstrates poor use of proximity, as related items are not consistently grouped together and unrelated products are often placed side-by-side. Product images, prices, and descriptions sometimes feel loosely connected, forcing users to work harder to understand which text belongs to which item. This weak grouping increases cognitive load and makes the page harder to browse efficiently.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!--Good Page Example-->
            <section class="infoBlock">
                <!--Page Name & Link-->
                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/store">Apple.com/store</a></h3>
                
                <figure>
                    <!--Image-->
                    <img src="../itis3135/images/AppleStore.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of Apple.com/Store showing its clean layout"
                    width="800"
                    height="400"
                    >

                <!--List Explaining Stuff-->
                <h4>How does this website adhere to the C.R.A.P principles ?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Contrast: </b>The site uses contrast effectively by combining a clean, light background with darker text and bold product imagery, making important information easy to notice and read. Key headings and featured messages stand out without overwhelming the page. This controlled contrast guides the user&#8217;s attention while maintaining visual comfort.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Repetition: </b>The design shows strong repetition through consistent fonts, colors, spacing, and component styles across the page. Navigation elements, product tiles, and buttons follow the same visual patterns, which creates a cohesive and recognizable interface. This consistency strengthens the brand identity and makes the layout feel unified.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Alignment: </b>Alignment is handled very well, with products, headings, and navigation elements arranged along a clear grid. Content lines up evenly across rows and columns, creating a clean and professional appearance. This structured alignment makes the page easy to scan and improves overall readability.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Proximity: </b>The site uses proximity effectively by grouping related products, navigation items, and support links into clearly defined sections. Each product category is visually clustered with its label and image, making relationships between elements immediately clear. This grouping helps users quickly understand options and navigate efficiently.</p></li>
                </ul>
